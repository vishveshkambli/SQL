What is the difference between domain specific & real programming language?
    Domain specific langauages usually are less complex then general purpose
    programing language, such as Java, C or Ruby. They are intended to be used
    not just by progrmmers but also by non-programmers who are fluent in the domain
    which the domain specific language addresses.
